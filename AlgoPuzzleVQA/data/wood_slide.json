{"image": "images/wood_slide/wood_slide_0099.jpg", "question": "Consider a sliding block puzzle of grid size 5 * 4 units. It has 9 wooden blocks of varying sizes: one 2 * 2, four 1 * 2, two 2 * 1, and two 1 * 1. The gird also has two empty 1 * 1 spaces. The blocks cannot be removed from the grid, and may only be slid horizontally and vertically within its boundary. A move is defined as selecting a block that is slideable, and moving it by 1 unit either horizontally or vertically, whichever is possible.
